This program will let you view FF7 world maps.

You will need `wm0.map` from the FF7 PS1 CD. Any version of the game will do.
Look inside the `world` folder. You can use `wm0.map` for the overworld,
`wm1.map` for the submarine map, and `wm2.map` for the Great Glacier snowstorm
map.

Build with `make`, then do `./ff7tool world wm0.map`
